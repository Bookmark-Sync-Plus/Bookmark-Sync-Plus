# Bookmark-Sync-Plus

Sync bookmarks among browsers/platforms.

## Implementation

:confused: Given GitHub OAuth token, we could read/write gist.  
:wink: Use that gist as a user's own private cloud bookmark storage.  
:smile: Chrome/Firefox Mobile could sync bookmarks with account logged in.  
:flushed: How to do that on Safari?
